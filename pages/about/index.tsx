    My name is Charlotte Chiffon but everyone calls me Chiffon! I was born in
    June, 2018 and am living the dream in my forever home in New York City. I
    love to dance for treats and accompany my mommy to the dance studio to watch
    her dance too. I also love cooking with my mommy at home! I have fun playing
    dress up at home and dreaming of being a princess.
