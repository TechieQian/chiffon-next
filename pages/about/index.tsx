      My name is Charlotte Chiffon but everyone calls me Chiffon! I was born in
      June, 2018 and am living the dream in my forever home in New York City. I
      love to dance for treats and accompany my mommy to the dance studio to
      watch her dance too. I also love cooking with my mommy at home! I have fun
      playing dress up at home and dreaming of being a princess.
